# The Pond Project

  The Pond Project is simply kindness passed on. Samaritan is the name of the backend application that runs thepondproject.org .
  Samaritan is maintained by Kindnesspassedon.
  

## How it works

 Step 1: Take action! Start a ripple effect of kindness by doing a random kind act.
 Step 2: Add your ripple of kindness to the pond by scanning your KindCard and submitting ripple.
 Step 3: Leave the KindCard with the recipient of your good deed.
 Step 4: The recipient restarts the process at step 1 and continues the ripple effect.
